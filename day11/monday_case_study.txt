4 years ago, Facebook was considering building a product around high schools.
At the time, we had 30M (global) userids who had filled in a text field
(no associated pages) with the supposed name of their current high school.

Question: How much of this data is real? We'd like to get an approximation
with only Facebook data, so no trying to put together a listing of public high
schools.

get all these people's median login location
test to see how close these are
what percentage of these listings have another person with same/similar
high school in 10 mile radius, perhaps? (maybe 5, see if it differs much)
you probably have to stem or whatever
well, would all people in a high school using a joke name still count as real?

could also check email addresses, since many use school email (or did, iirc)
