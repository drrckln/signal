get all these people's median login location
test to see how close these are
what percentage of these listings have another person with same/similar
high school in 10 mile radius, perhaps? (maybe 5, see if it differs much)
you probably have to stem or whatever
well, would all people in a high school using a joke name still count as real?

could also check email addresses, since many use school email (or did, iirc)
