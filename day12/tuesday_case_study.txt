Hmm. One simple metric would be to calculate a like-to-comment ratio, or rather
you would need to intersect likes to comments (by putting the owners of each
into separate sets). Someone who likes something should simply like it; if they
add a comment or simply comment without liking it's fairly high probablity that
they'd like to express some other emotion/affect.

Also short reactions in comments are a better proxy than paragraphs. You could
also check for emoji. Union the two, instead of just using "comments." Checking
for emoji and emoticon frequency could give you some idea of what reactions are
a good idea to implement. (This is confounded because it turns out emoji are
not in any real way standardized.) To be honest I would play prior scientist
here and use the discovered universal emotions.



Yeah, how to test it? The problem is that both sides need to be implementing
this; I suppose you could simply deprecate and default to "like" for positive
emoticons and nothing for others. Another solution would be to pick little
subnetworks to test this out in -- friend groups, or closed/open groups in
general. Then the feature would only work internally in the group.



First is simply the usage rate of the feature vs simple likes. If it's quite a
bit higher, then that's indicating value. Now, what about magnitude? You can
take your previous metrics and see how they compare; is the new feature
cannibalizing short reactions and emoji reactions?

Also people like new features and will play with it, so you probably have to
wait a month and then start tracking these.
