Violence in schools directly affects educators and students by reducing
school effectiveness and inhibiting student learning. Additionally, unsafe
school environments expose students who may already be at risk for school
failure to physical and emotional harm. In recent years, educators and
policymakers have voiced growing concern about possible increases in the
incidence of school-related criminal behavior. Studying trends in
victimization rates provides a picture of the safety of today s schools.
